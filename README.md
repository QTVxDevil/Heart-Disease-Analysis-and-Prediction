# Importing packages and libraries
- Some useful packages and libraries:
    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import seaborn as sns
    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
    from sklearn.svm import SVC
    from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Importing Dataset
- Filename: 'heart.csv'

# Explanatory
### Missing Data
- Check missing data of each feature

### Heat map
- Check correlation between numerical features
  
### Visualization target based on feature

# Train and Test split
- Split dataset into train_set and test_set with ratio 7:3.

# Features scaling
- Feature Scaling is scaling all features to make sure they all take values on the same scale. It prevents one feature to dominate over the other. Feature Scaling is done after we split the dataset into the training set and test set and it is applied to the training set.

# Build models
- **Random Forest Model**
- **Support Vector Classification Model**
  
# Upgrade the SVC model
- Upgrade the SVC model for higher performance

# Submissions
- Compare between actual set and predicted set
